### IMPORTANT: Environment Variable Configuration

1. Copy the file `src/environments/environment.example.ts` to `src/environments/environment.ts`.
2. Fill in the variables `emailjsServiceId`, `emailjsTemplateId`, and `emailjsUserId` with your EmailJS credentials.
3. The `environment.ts` file **should not be committed to the repository**, as it contains sensitive information (it is listed in `.gitignore`).
